# Endless-Remix
Ok so what I plan to achieve with this system (and hopefully it isn't too bothersome for you guys)
I'm always gonna keep the regualar miss to not fail tickflow updated and thats what you can test on.
When we get closer to release times I will update the old version for older hardware so we can test that aswell.
So if you want to playtest it you'll have to compile it yourself (it's just easier because I probably won't remember to do it lol)
